# HOW TO USE IT?

First, grab RamState.hx and put it in source/states/

After, go to source/main.hx and put this in line 19:
´import states.RamState´

After that, go to line 44 (InitialState) and change the TitleState to RamState.

# HOW TO MODIFY IT?

In RamState.hx, change the X in the lines: 22, 31 and 32 to the AMOUNT OF RAM NECESSARY TO RUN YOUR MOD.

And in line 22, change the <yourmodname> to literally your mod name.

You should be good to go after this.
